# Text Classifiers
This is a beginner friendly repo for those who want to use DL techniques in Natural Language Processing for text classification.</br>
It uses **Tensorflow 2.0** framework for implementing deep learning models, with handy datasets.</br>

## Getting Started

You only need google account for the whole process to get started.Just open the notebooks using [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which is an awesome tool provided from **GOOGLE**, cuz it gives you **FREE GPUs!!!**.

### Prerequisites

Only thing required is python, rest other things will be handled while exploration.</br> Knowing **Tensorflow** could help a lot to understand notebooks very quickly.

## What's in there?

There are Various Classifier notebooks for different use-cases.</br>
- [IMDB-movie-review](https://github.com/kb10241024/Text_Classifiers/tree/master/IMDB)
- [Sarcasm-Detection](https://github.com/kb10241024/Text_Classifiers/tree/master/Sarcasm)
- [BBC](https://github.com/kb10241024/Text_Classifiers/blob/master/MultiClass/BBC/BBC_text_multiclass_classification.ipynb) (Text Classification into five topics{sport': 1, 'business': 2, 'politics': 3, 'tech': 4, 'entertainment': 5}, using BBC text-corpora).

## What you'll Learn?

* **Handling text-data**, which is far more difficult than handling images(Embeddings, Tokenization, Padding and Truncating, Stopwords and Lemmatization / Stemming)
* GRU, LSTM and other **Recurrent Units**, Bidirectional RNNs also **1d-convolutions**, which is better technique for classification.
* **Analyzing** accuracy and loss.
